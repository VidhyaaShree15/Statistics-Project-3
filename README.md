# Statistics Project 3

## Overview
This repository contains a statistics project covering tasks such as sampling from distributions, visualizing multi-dimensional data, creating QQ plots, computing distribution convolutions, and analyzing sampling means.

## Skills Used
- Sampling Distributions
- Multi-dimensional Data Visualization
- QQ Plots
- Convolution of Distributions
- Sampling Means Analysis

## Contents
1. **Sampling and Visualization:**
   - Generate and visualize 4-D data using normal and uniform distributions.

2. **QQ Plot:**
   - Create a QQ plot for standard normal and standard Cauchy distributions.

3. **Convolution of Distributions:**
   - Compute the convolution of Beta(2,8) and Beta(8,2) distributions.

4. **Sampling Means:**
   - Compute and visualize sample means and their distributions.

## Usage
Ensure Python and required libraries are installed. Run the provided code in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment.

## File
- `statistics-project-3.pdf`: Contains all the project code and analyses.
